## User Story
<!-- As a busy person, when I use Flavor Express, I am able to view recipes. When I sign-up, I can login using my username and password. Once logged in, I am taken to my dashboard page. I can create a new recipe using the form, click create button and a newly created recipe will appear in my dashboard. When I click on one of my recipe photos or edit recipe button, I am taken to the edit page where I can edit the title, ingredients, direction, hint or photo by clicking the update recipe button or delete the recipe using the delete recipe button. When I click update recipe, then I am redirected to my dashboard and that recipe is updated. When I click on view recipe button or the recipe picture on the recipes page, I am taken to the single recipe where I can view the picture, ingredients, direction, express hint and rate the recipe with cookies icon or leave a comment, then click on rate it. I am able to delete any rating I have on the recipe and see other comments as well. If I am not logged in, I can see the recipe and the comments or ratings but cannot edit them even if they were posted by me. When I click on logout, I return to the main page. -->

## Installation
To install this application, clone the repository.
Run $npm i.
Create an .env file.
In the file, add your database information and AWS access code. 

## Usage
Use this application to match up someone with similar personality trait and send them a gift. You may also create your gift wish list and someone might send you a gift from your list!

## Challenges
This project took us some time at mapping our models for how everything could be linked together. At the begining, we were not able to figure how we summerize the personality traits result from the answers the users provided. We also went back and forth at how the gift should be traced by the sender.
